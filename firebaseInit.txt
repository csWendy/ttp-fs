ou're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /Users/xiaoning

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing in an existing Firebase project directory


=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

i  .firebaserc already has a default project, using treasureisland-8ebec.

=== Functions Setup

A functions directory will be created in your project with a Node.js
package pre-configured. Functions can be deployed with firebase deploy.
